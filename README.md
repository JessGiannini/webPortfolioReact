# React Web Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Every great developer needs a place to showcase their work. This web portfolio is my first attempt at using React to build a front end website.

## User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context

Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
